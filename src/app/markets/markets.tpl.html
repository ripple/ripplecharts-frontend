      <h5>Live Trade Feed</h5>
      <p>
        The live trade feed shows the most recent trades for the 
        selected currency pair, the latest trade price and
        the 24 hour high, low, and volume.
      </p>
      <p>  
        The large number at the top is the latest trade price.
        Currency prices are always quoted in relation to one another, e.g. XRP/USD.    
        The first currency in the pair is called the "base currency".  
        The second one is called the "counter currency". The price quote shows 
        the value of 1 unit of base currency in terms of the counter currency.          
      </p>
      <p>  
        The table below is a real-time ticker of the latest trades.   
        The colored bar shows if the trade price was higher, lower or the 
        same as the previous trade listed directly below. The left column shows the
        amount traded and the right column shows the trade price.

      <h5>Order Book</h5>
      <p>
        The current order book for the selected currency pair is below - 
        these are orders across the Ripple Network that have been placed
        but not yet filled. "Bids" are orders to buy the base currency, and 
        "Asks" are orders to sell the base currency. The “Total” column shows 
        the total amount of currency anyone can get at that price. The "Size"
        columns show the amount of base currency available to buy or sell at
        "Bid Price" or "Ask Price." The blue line shows the depth of the order 
        book - the amount of base currency available at different rates. The 
        vertical line represents the midpoint between the best bid and ask price
        which is the current market price.
